  <p>
    I am currently an Associate Professor with the [VCC group](https://vcc.tech/) at Shenzhen University. Before joining SZU, I worked with [Prof. Chiew-Lan Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~taicl) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I also obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2015, under the guidance of [Prof. Chiew-Lan Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~taicl) and [Prof. Hongbo Fu](https://hongbofu.people.ust.hk/). Before that, I received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2009. My research falls in Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction, especially automatic/interactive 2D and 3D content creation.

    I am currently looking for master students. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
